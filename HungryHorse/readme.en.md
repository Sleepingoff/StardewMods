## 📖 Introduction

`Hungry Horse` adds **Stamina** and **Friendship** systems for your horse.  
When riding a horse, **stamina decreases over time**, and you need to **feed your horse or let it rest overnight** to recover.  
Additionally, a **friendship system** has been implemented, allowing you to build a stronger bond with your horse.

## 🎮 Features

- 🏃‍♂️ **Horse Stamina System**

  - Stamina decreases when running with the horse.
  - Walking does not consume stamina.
  - The horse slowly recovers stamina when in the farm.
  - Stamina is fully restored every morning.

- 🍎 **Horse Feeding System**

  - You can feed your horse **Carrots, Summer Squash, Broccoli, and Powdermelon**.
  - Feeding restores stamina and increases friendship.
  - If stamina is full, you cannot feed the horse.

- ❤️ **Horse Friendship System**

  - **Petting once per day**: +20 friendship.
  - **Feeding**: +10 friendship.
  - **Leaving the horse outside the farm overnight**: -50 friendship.

- ⚡ **Speed Buff & Debuff**
